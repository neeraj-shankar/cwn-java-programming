### **Django Framework**

- Core concepts: Models, Views, Templates, Middleware.
- ORM: Complex queries, relationships (OneToOne, ForeignKey, ManyToMany).
- Django REST Framework (DRF): Serializers, ViewSets, authentication, and permissions.
- Deployment: Django on production servers (Gunicorn, Nginx).

### **Database Skills**

- PostgreSQL: Write and optimize complex queries, indexing, and transactions.
- ORMs: Efficient query optimization.
- Work with database migrations.

### **Asynchronous Services**

- Kafka and RabbitMQ: Understand their architecture, differences, and use cases.
- Celery workers: Task queues, result backend, periodic tasks, and best practices.

### **API Development**

- RESTful principles: CRUD operations, versioning, status codes, and documentation.
- Security: Authentication, authorization, rate-limiting, and data validation.

### **DevOps and Deployment**

- Docker: Create and manage containers for your apps.
- CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or similar tools.
- Cloud: Familiarize yourself with AWS or GCP basics.

---

## **2. System Design**

- Study design patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.
- Scalable system design: Learn to design microservices, databases, caching, and load balancers.
- Common scenarios: URL shortening, chat applications, or payment gateways.
- Resources: "System Design Primer" on GitHub, YouTube tutorials, and case studies.

## **3. Coding Interviews**

### **Data Structures and Algorithms**

- Focus Areas:
  - Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, HashMaps.
  - Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and Backtracking.
- Practice on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal.
- Specifically, solve problems involving iteration counts in loops (your challenge area).

---

## **4. Behavioral Interviews**

- Prepare STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) stories for:
  - Challenges youâ€™ve faced.
  - Achievements in your projects.
  - Instances of team collaboration and conflict resolution.
- Common questions:
  - "Why do you want to switch roles?"
  - "Describe a challenging problem you solved in your current role."

---

## **5. Mock Interviews**

- Conduct mock interviews with peers or platforms like Pramp.
- Request feedback on technical, problem-solving, and communication skills.

---

## **6. Networking**

- Update your LinkedIn profile to highlight your skills and experience.
- Reach out to former colleagues and mentors for referrals and insights.

---

## **7. Java and Spring Boot**

Since you're planning to transition into Java and Spring Boot:

- Familiarize yourself with Java basics and the Collection Framework.
- Begin learning Spring Boot for REST API development and microservices.
- Implement small projects to demonstrate proficiency.
