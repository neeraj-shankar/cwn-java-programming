Here’s a structured 4-month roadmap to master Java programming and Spring Boot:

---

### **Month 1: Solidify Core Java Skills**

1. **Core Java Concepts**

   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation.
   - Core APIs: Collections Framework (List, Set, Map), Streams, Generics.
   - Multithreading and Concurrency.
   - Exception Handling.
   - File I/O and Serialization.
2. **Tools and Best Practices**

   - IDE: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
   - Git and GitHub for version control.
   - Java coding conventions.
3. **Hands-On Practice**

   - Build mini-projects like a Library Management System or Bank Account System.
   - Solve coding problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.

### **Month 2: Advanced Java and Basics of Spring**

1. **Advanced Java**

   - JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
   - Java 8+ features (Streams API, Lambdas, Optional, Date-Time API).
   - Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.).
2. **Intro to Spring Framework**

   - Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC).
   - Spring Core Module.
   - Basic Spring Configuration (XML and Annotations).
3. **Project**

   - Create a Java-based RESTful API using Servlets and JDBC.

### **Month 3: Spring Boot Mastery**

1. **Spring Boot Essentials**

   - Introduction to Spring Boot.
   - Spring Boot Annotations (@RestController, @Autowired, etc.).
   - Spring Boot Starter Dependencies.
2. **Develop REST APIs**

   - Building CRUD operations.
   - Request mapping and validation.
   - Handling exceptions in Spring Boot.
3. **Database Integration**

   - Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.
   - Writing Repository Queries.
   - Using MySQL/PostgreSQL databases.
4. **Hands-On Project**

   - Create a RESTful API for an E-commerce platform (Product, User, Order modules).

### **Month 4: Advanced Spring Boot and Real-World Applications**

1. **Advanced Spring Boot**

   - Security: Spring Security and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Logging and Monitoring with Spring Boot Actuator.
   - Caching with Spring Cache.
2. **Microservices and Cloud**

   - Introduction to Microservices architecture.
   - Building Microservices with Spring Boot.
   - Deployment on AWS or Azure.
3. **Testing**

   - Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito.
   - Integration Testing.
4. **Capstone Project**

   - Build a scalable, secure, and deployable application (e.g., a Task Management System or Blogging Platform).

### **Daily/Weekly Routine**

- **Daily**: Spend 2–3 hours coding and practicing concepts.
- **Weekly**: Work on a mini-project or solve DSA problems in Java.
