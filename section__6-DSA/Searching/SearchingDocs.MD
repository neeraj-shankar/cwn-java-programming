Binary Search is a fundamental algorithm used to efficiently find a target element in a sorted array. It operates on the principle of divide and conquer, repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at the concept:

### How Binary Search Works

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Start with two pointers: `low` pointing to the first element of the array and `high` pointing to the last element.

2. **Middle Element**:
   - Calculate the middle index: `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the target value with the middle element:
     - If they are equal, the target is found, and the index `mid` is returned.
     - If the target is less than the middle element, adjust the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
     - If the target is greater than the middle element, adjust the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.

4. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat the process until `low` exceeds `high`. If the loop exits without finding the target, it means the target is not present in the array.

### Binary Search Algorithm in Java

Here's a simple implementation of Binary Search in Java:

```java
public class BinarySearch {
    public static int binarySearch(int[] array, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = array.length - 1;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // Prevents overflow
            
            if (array[mid] == target) {
                return mid; // Target found
            }
            if (array[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1; // Search right half
            } else {
                high = mid - 1; // Search left half
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // Target not found
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] sortedArray = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};
        int target = 10;
        int result = binarySearch(sortedArray, target);
        
        if (result == -1) {
            System.out.println("Element not present in array");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element found at index " + result);
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This efficiency is due to halving the search space in each step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the iterative approach, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

### Important Considerations

- **Sorted Array**: Binary Search requires the input array to be sorted beforehand.
- **Overflow**: To avoid overflow in languages where integer overflow can occur, calculate the middle index using `mid = low + (high - low) / 2` instead of `(low + high) / 2`.

Practicing binary search problems is a great way to solidify your understanding of the algorithm. Here are some problems that you can tackle to hone your skills:

### Binary Search Practice Problems

1. **Classic Binary Search**:
   - **Problem**: Implement a function that searches for a target value in a sorted integer array and returns its index. If the target is not found, return -1.
   - **Challenge**: Handle edge cases such as an empty array and ensure your solution prevents overflow.

2. **Find the First and Last Position of an Element in a Sorted Array**:
   - **Problem**: Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If the target is not found, return [-1, -1].
   - **Hint**: Use binary search to find the first occurrence, and then search again to find the last occurrence.

3. **Search Insert Position**:
   - **Problem**: Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
   - **Challenge**: Optimize your solution to run in O(log n) time.

4. **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**:
   - **Problem**: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum element.
   - **Hint**: Modify the binary search to account for the rotation.

5. **Peak Element**:
   - **Problem**: A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Given an input array, find a peak element and return its index. The array may contain multiple peaks; return the index of any one of them.
   - **Hint**: Use binary search to efficiently find a peak element.

6. **Square Root**:
   - **Problem**: Implement integer square root function. Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x. Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part is returned.
   - **Challenge**: Solve it using binary search with O(log n) complexity.

7. **Find K Closest Elements**:
   - **Problem**: Given a sorted array and two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.
   - **Hint**: Use binary search to find the closest element, then expand outwards to find all k elements.
